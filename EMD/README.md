## Instructions

Open Matlab and run EMD_main.m. This file contains implement of three algorithms: PDHG, APDHG and iPrePDHG. 
Each algorithm requires about 300 seconds to finish.

(Another file, slow_algorithms.m, implements other benchmark algorithms mentioned in the paper, all of which are extremely slow for this problem. They can be tested after running the first two sections in EMD_main.m regardless.)
